# DA_Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio <br> 

Here you will find all the projects that I have done, guided and unguided. 

The projects are separated in different files names project<'project number'>, eg: **project1** <br>
***I highly encourage reading the 'readme' files in each of the project folders as they have detailed documentation of the projects***

This is a work-in-progress portfolio, more projects will be added once they are completed. 

### An abstract about the projects: <br>
* **Project 1** : This project utilises **'Google-Sheets'** to clean the data and then to convert to a ***'.csv'*** format, **'BigQuery'** to query the data set, and further uses **'Tableau'** for the visualisation. **Title** : ***'Hotel Revenue Analysis and Visualisation'***. <br>
* **Project 2** : This project makes use of **'R'** programming language to analyse and visualise the data. **Title** : ***'Rise and Fall of Programming Languages'***.
* **Project 3** : This project uses Excel and it's tools to clean, summarise and visualise data. **Title** : ***'Bike Purchase Analysis and Visualisation Dashboard with Excel'***.
