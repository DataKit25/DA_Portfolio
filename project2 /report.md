# Rise and Fall of Programming Language

## Overview

This project delves into the historical trends and patterns surrounding the popularity of programming languages over time. I utilized R and R Markdown for a comprehensive analysis and data visualization, aiming to uncover insights into the dynamic landscape of programming languages.

## Project Goals

- Analyze historical data of programming language usage.
- Identify trends and factors contributing to the rise and fall of specific languages.
- Create informative visualizations to effectively present our findings.

## Data Sources

The data was downloaded from the Stack Exchange website. 

## Tools and Technologies

- **R**: I used the R programming language for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **R Packages**: I leveraged several R packages, such as `ggplot2` for data visualization and `dplyr` for data manipulation.
- **R Markdown**: I documented my analysis in R Markdown files to make the project more accessible and reproducible.

## Project Structure

- **analysis**: R Markdown file documenting the step-by-step analysis process.
- **data**: This directory contains the data file used in the analysis.
- **scripts**: R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **visualizations**: Visualizations generated from the data analysis.
- **reports**: Project report (readme-file).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open and run the R Markdown files in the `analysis` directory to view the analysis process.
4. Execute R scripts in the `scripts` directory to reproduce specific analyses or visualizations.

## Results

The analysis uncovered valuable insights into the evolution of the programming language landscape. Please refer to the R Markdown files and visualizations in the `analysis` and `visualizations` directories for detailed findings and conclusions.
