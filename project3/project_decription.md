## Project Name: Bike Purchase Analysis and Visualization Dashboard with Excel

Description:

In this project, I developed a comprehensive bike purchase analysis and visualization dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The primary objective was to investigate whether individuals had purchased a bike based on a range of parameters, including income, gender, age, commute distance, and the number of children in their households. Here's an overview of the key steps and processes involved:

**Data Cleaning:**
- The project commenced with the meticulous cleaning of the raw data to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
- Duplicate values were identified and eliminated to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
- Data standardization was undertaken to enhance data consistency. Specifically, values in certain columns were standardized:
   - Marital Status: 'M' was transformed to 'Married,' and 'S' was updated to 'Single.'
   - Gender: 'M' was adjusted to 'Male,' and 'F' was modified to 'Female.'
   - Commute Distance: '10+ Miles' was replaced with 'More than 10 Miles.'
- A new column, 'Age Bracket,' was introduced to categorize individuals into three distinct age groups: 'Adolescent,' 'Middle Age,' and 'Old.' This categorization was based on the 'Age' column data.

**Data Analysis and Visualization:**
- Excel's robust features were harnessed to create pivot tables, enabling data aggregation and summary.
- These pivot tables formed the foundation for generating insightful visualizations that facilitated data comprehension and decision-making.
- The dashboard incorporated various types of visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and pivot charts, strategically selected to represent different aspects of the dataset.
- Parameters such as income, gender, age, commute distance, and the number of children were carefully analyzed to identify significant trends and patterns among individuals who purchased bikes.
- Interactive filters and slicers were seamlessly integrated into the dashboard, allowing users to dynamically interact with the data and tailor their view based on specific criteria.
